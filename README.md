# lambda_nfa_to_dfa
- convert lambda Nondeterministic finite automaton to deterministic finite automaton
- check if input string is accepted in automata
# input format
- first line is 5 number wich is: amount of input automaton states, amount of alphabet, amount of accept states, amount of transitions,amount of input string that would check is accepted in automaton
- next lines are language alphabets
- next line is initial state
- next lines are accepting states
- next lines are transitions in this format(first-state transition-symbol second-state)
- next lines are input string that would check
